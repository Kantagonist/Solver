This project's aim is to create a sudoku solving algorithm for all possible versions of the game.
I created it to familiarize myself with the use of github and git in a real-world scenario.

This repo is the successor to a different, with which i had problems in Git.
While its history is now gone, it wasn't very spectacular or granted a great look inside the working process.
So nothing is lost in that sense.

The current repois my given eclipse workspace, to ease clonimg the project.

The roadmap is as follows:
1. Create working and tested algorithm in Java as a basis for what is to come.
2. Port the algorithm to C++ and compare runtimes.
3. Port the algorithm to JavaScript or Python.
